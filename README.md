## Overview

This is a Turing School of Software and Design Module 2 project. This project was designed by us. Its intention is to be able to view a list of recipes. Based on those recipes, a randomly selected user can favorite recipes and add them to a page of recipes to cook. A user can view the ingredients they have in their pantry. When a recipe is selected the user can try to cook that dish. When a recipe can not be cooked, the user will be shown how many more ingredients will be needed. If they can cook it, the ingredients will be subtracted from their pantry.


## Learning Goals

* Get better with iterator methods.
* Start a webpage from scratch without a comp to base it on
* Increase understanding of DOM last
* Work on test first classes
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP


## Technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Git
* GitHub

## Cook Recipe

The user can attempt to cook any recipe. If the user can't cook the recipe, the page will tell the user what ingredients they need. If they can cook the recipe, the users pantry will be effected.
